                    <p style="font-style: italic;">
                      This fall semester, Princeton University is offering a new class
                      DRI 101: Driver’s Education. Our game, Driver’s Education,
                      is an infinite-runner game in which a player controls a car driving down
                      Washington Road. Each player is given three lives (or three chances in the class),
                      and every time they hit an obstacle they lose a life.
                      The player uses the arrow keys to dodge the obstacles— pedestrians,
                      crossing animals, and other cars— all while trying to collect coins.
                      The goal of the game: get as many coins as possible without getting
                      kicked out of the class. Driver’s Education uses graphic concepts,
                      such as polygonal meshes, light rendering, and collision modelling, t
                      o create an enjoyable and aesthetically-pleasing game for players.

                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p> <h3> Goals </h3> </p>
                    <p>
                      Driver’s Education is an infinite-runner style game.
                      The player controls a car that is driving down a rendered
                      cartoon-version of Washington Road complete with all the iconic
                      buildings on Princeton’s campus. In making this game, we wanted
                      to pay homage to infinite-runner games that we played when we
                      were young, like Temple Run and Crossy Road. To do so, we
                      created obstacles in the path of our driver, like pedestrians
                      and animals, that the player needs to weave around as well as
                      coins and boost items to collect. Beyond video games, we were
                      also inspired by content covered in the second-half of the course.
                      We wanted to invoke different lighting effects through our changing
                      day scenery and model cartoon-esque collisions between objects.
                      Our final product is a reflection of both our fond memories of
                      video games from our childhood and appreciation for the
                      computer graphics knowledge we have learned this semester.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The purpose of this game, like most video games, is to serve
                      as a relaxing activity for the player and be a fun distraction.
                      We thought that designing games like Driver’s Education is
                      especially given the circumstances we are in. Having video games
                      can make being quarantined more enjoyable and pass the time quicker.
                      More importantly, like many Princeton students, we the creators miss
                      being on the University’s campus and enjoying the spring semester.
                      That is why we chose to recreate Princeton scenery and niche inside
                      campus jokes as a means to have a bit of campus with us even though
                      we are away from it. For example, we made roadside objects
                      modeled after Princeton buildings, such as the Friend Center,
                      Fine Hall, and Frist. In our obstacles, we included the campus
                      fox— a running gag amongst students. Overall, we wanted to
                      create a light-hearted activity that sparks a bit of joy for
                      Princeton students during a difficult time.
                    </p>
                    <p> <h3> Previous Work </h3> </p>
                    <p>
                      For Driver’s Ed, we were inspired by industrial examples, Temple Run and Crossy Road,
                      and open-source examples, Aviator and Boxy Run:
                      <li>
                         In <strong>Temple Run</strong>, the player controls an explorer who is
                        being chased by demonic monkeys. The point of the game is
                        to run for as long as possible while avoiding obstacles and
                        collecting coins for boosts and points.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        In <strong>Crossy Road</strong>, the player controls a character who
                        must cross a series of endless roads and highways.
                        Similar to Temple Run, the point is to get as far as
                        possible without dying from obstacles or staying idle for too long.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        In <strong>Aviator</strong>, the player controls an infinitely flying plane
                        and must fly for as long of a distance as possible.
                        While doing so, the player must avoid red shapes to
                        conserve energy and collect blue shapes to proceed to the next level.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        In <strong>Boxy Run</strong>, which was inspired by Temple Run, the player
                        controls a running man and tries to get as far as possible
                        while avoiding tree obstacles.
                      </li>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Despite the varying premises of each example, all four games share
                      the same style where the character must stay alive as long as possible
                      while navigating through an endless path filled with obstacles and rewards.
                      We feel that this infinite-runner style approach is very successful,
                      as it provides the perfect balance between stress and reward. Specifically,
                      it keeps players on edge, curious about what is about to come next, and
                      provides instant gratification for successfully avoiding the upcoming obstacle
                      or collecting the reward. It also allows players to get into a “zone,”
                      a sort of relaxing, yet thrilling, flow from overcoming the dynamic challenges.
                      Above all, these games are simple to play, with controls and goals that are
                      easy to understand, but challenging enough to prevent players from mastering t
                      he entire game. Here, the only competitor is the player and their previous high score.
                      There’s a certain level of personal skill required and the development of this
                      skill feels obtainable, which ensures players always come back to play.
                    </p>
                    <p> <h3> Approach </h3> </p>
                      <li> <strong> <u> User Experience: </u> </strong> Considering how infinite-runner games
                        like Temple Run and Crossy Road have proved to be widely successful,
                        we decided to take a similar approach. The controls and goal of the game
                        are simple and there are enough obstacles on the road to create a right
                        amount of challenge. Other than to dodge obstacles, there’s also an
                        incentive for the player to move around to collect coins for a high score
                        and the occasional invincibility item to help them last longer.
                        Collectively, we feel that this infinite-runner style with the right amount
                        of obstacles and rewards would give players a satisfying thrill and desire
                        to keep playing to top their personal scores.
                      </li>
                      <li> <strong> <u> High-Level Game Design:</u> </strong> We wanted to keep the
                        objective and controls of Driver’s Ed rather simple so players would
                        have little difficulty learning the game. Because of this, we first
                        created the game basics of just controlling a car with a small number
                        of obstacles and coins on the road before moving forward to add more
                        scenery, complex obstacles/prizes, acceleration/deceleration features a
                        nd temporal changes. This proved to be an effective and efficient process,
                        as we ensured we had the rudimentary base of the game down before
                        adding more elaborate features to maintain user engagement and
                        ensure the right amount of difficulty.
                      </li>
                      <li> <strong> <u> Low-Level Game Design: </u></strong> Driver’s Ed was created
                        primarily using JavaScript and the three.js library.
                        We chose to use three.js because it is well-documented and because
                        all of us have experience with it from the assignments.
                        All of the user interfaces, such as the pop-up begin instructions
                        and score/lives board, were created using HTML and CSS.

                    <h2>Results</h2>
                    <p>
                      We measured success during the creation process by playing
                      the game ourselves and making any changes that we saw fit.
                      For example, in early iterations of the game, we originally
                      planned to only have the pedestrians and foxes as potential obstacles.
                      However, after playing it ourselves, we found the game to be too easy,
                      which inspired us to add more meshes, like the crosswalks and other
                      cars on the road in order to make the game more lively. Given that
                      we fall within the target audience (i.e. Princeton students) of this
                      game, we felt that play-testing the game during the initial phases
                      was an adequate reflection of the opinions of actual potential players.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      After implementing the features we wanted and creating a game
                      that we were satisfied with, we shared our game with peers to get
                      feedback. Getting outside advice was important to us because
                      we wanted to see how outsiders who had not been part of the game
                      development process reacted to our game. We sent our game link out to other
                      Princeton students that we knew. In general, the feedback that we received
                      was positive. In particular, people were impressed with the amount of detail
                      and the Princeton-specific meshes that we included in the game. We consider
                      the game a success given the amount of people who told us that the game was
                      “extremely fun to play” and even “addictive”. Some constructive
                      feedback we received was related to additional features,
                      such as a background song or including an incentive for faster
                      speed. Also, there were comments about lag time for different
                      computers, leading us to do more optimizations on our game.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Overall, the results were positive and indicated that the we had fulfilled the goals we set out to accomplish (i.e. making a fun game and reminding people of Princeton).

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                      We implemented all of our target goals and several of our stretch goals,
                      including a few that we added along the way. Some of our target goals
                      included achieving a consistent low poly aesthetic, modeling many of the recognizable
                      buildings on Princeton’s campus, and implementing all the basic features
                      of an infinite runner game. We also fulfilled our main stretch goal of
                      adding in a night mode. Seeing the game grow from a few disjoint meshes
                      and moving cubes to a scene of the campus we left behind this semester
                      was a great experience, and we are very happy with our final result.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Given more time, we would like to augment the scene with more
                      “Princeton” and maybe even include small Princeton-related easter eggs.
                      Additional challenges could also be added to the game, such as an
                      increasing number of obstacles or a gradually increasing game speed.
                      A great way to expand the scope of the game would be to keep track of
                      high scores with a backend. Certain things could also be improved,
                      such as the collision model for vehicles. There could also be more
                      modularity introduced into the code, to avoid repeated variables and
                      initializations. For example, a more global framework for detecting
                      collisions should be written so that similar object-specific collision
                      behaviors do not need to be repeatedly coded for each object.
